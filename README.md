## What is the Intersection Observer?

> The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport.

Using the Intersection Observer, we are able to run a callback function whenever a target element intersected the viewport or a specified element.
